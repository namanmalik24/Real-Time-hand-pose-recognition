# Real-Time Hand Pose Recognition

## Overview

This project is a real-time hand pose recognition system built using TensorFlow, React, JavaScript, and CSS. It utilizes TensorFlow.js to detect and track hand gestures in real-time using a webcam.

## Features

- **Real-time hand tracking** using TensorFlow.js
- **Interactive UI** built with React and styled with CSS
- **Gesture-based interactions** for various applications
- **Lightweight and runs in the browser** without additional installations

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow.js** – For real-time hand pose detection
- **React.js** – For building the frontend interface
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – For handling logic and data processing
- **CSS** – For styling the application

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/namanmalik24/Real-Time-hand-pose-recognition
   cd hand-pose-recognition
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000/` to see the application in action.

## Usage

- Allow access to the webcam when prompted.
- Perform different hand gestures in front of the camera.
- The model will recognize and display the detected hand pose.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more gesture-based controls for UI interactions
- Improve accuracy using a custom-trained model
- Extend support for multiple hands detection
